## 💻 Description

A web application visualizing the Graph ADT (Abstract Data Structure). Built using Javascript

## 🔎 Features

* Selection of four(5) types of Graphs, namely unweighted undirected, weighted undirected, unweighted directed, and weighted directed graphs
* Creating nodes, creating edges, and deleting elements by just interacting with the canvas
* Visualization of algorithms; Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Coloring, Kosaraju's Strongly Connected Components, Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree, and Dijkstra's Shortest Path Tree
* Animation speed slider

## 🔭 Possible Additions
-  More graph algorithms
